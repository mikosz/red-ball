===============
Red Ball Engine
===============

This is an excercise project used by by me when learning to program using DirectX 11. At the moment it is only buildable manually (personally I use Eclipse + MSVC), in the nearest future I'll probably finish the CMake build. After configuring the build and running the executable properly a patient user will be rewarded with a view of a cube moving around the window for a couple of seconds.

Features
========

Features of this engine are currently very small.

* Shading using a single diffuse, ambient and specular light (hard-coded)
* Loading simple Waveform .obj models (no materials)
* Texturing using a single .dds file (hard-coded)

External requirements
=====================

Libraries used in this project are:

* DirectX 11
* Boost (known to work with 1.47)
